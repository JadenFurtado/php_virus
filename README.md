### php_virus
A virus I wrote in PHP

# Overview:

Php as we know is rather infamous as it is easy to write insecure code in. It is also rather easy for a virus to infect a PHP file given how website in PHP are often written. And so PHP is the perfect language to write a web virus in.

Basically, this virus infects all your php files and will copy itself onto them and the process repeats.
I hope to be adding payloads(I was thinking using JSON) to this in the future.
Feel free to contribute to it and build on it if you please.

I won't deny, this virus has been heavily inspired by the video: 
Writing Viruses for fun and not for profit.

The speaker gives a detailed explanation about what viruses are and how they spread and affect computers.
I have built upon that work and will keep pushing updates, as and when I get the time. 

## Warning:

Please do not use this virus to cause any harm. I am not responsible for any misuse of the code.

## Also, please do not run this on your personal server/localhost, please run it in a virtual environment!
